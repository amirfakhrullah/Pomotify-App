Pomotify is a simple **Fullstack** Pomodoro timer app with Spotify integration. As a Pomodoro technique user and Spotify lover, I would love to have this kind of application. With Spotify in the web, users can focus on their study/work while listening to some playlists without the need to open their Spotify app.
